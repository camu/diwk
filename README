DIWK â€“ dynamic input widget kit
===============================
diwk aims to be a minimalistic kit for text-based
input widgets.

diwk's widgets are drawn like dmenu to the upper
side of the display. All needed widgets can be traced
back to these three basic widgets:
	1. normal input text box
	2. input text box w/o echo
	3. radio buttons
